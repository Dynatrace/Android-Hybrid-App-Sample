# Android-Hybrid-App-Sample

This sample app has been shared by Bert Van der Heyden, APM Consultant at RealDolmen Belgium.
Bert wanted to show how easy it is to instrument a Mobile Hybrid App with Dynatrace UEM. For that purpose he created a simple app based on the YouTube Tutorial [Creating a simple hybrid app with AngularJS, Ionic and Cordova](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCnGSOaaZFo)

Bert also created a [YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLIuPeFbXBA&index=46&list=PLqt2rd0eew1bmDn54E2_M2uvbhm_WxY_6) showing the steps necessary to instrumenting a Mobile Hybrid App with Dynatrace

The final result is that every single user of the app and all their user actions are captured with Dynatrace UEM. In this scenario he even instrumented the server-side Spring Boot Microservice which gave him full end-to-end visibility: from Mobile to Microservice:
