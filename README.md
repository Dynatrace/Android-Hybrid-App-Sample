# Android-Hybrid-App-Sample

This sample app has been shared by Bert Van der Heyden, APM Consultant at RealDolmen Belgium.
Bert wanted to show how easy it is to instrument a Mobile Hybrid App with Dynatrace UEM. For that purpose he created a symple app based on the YouTube Tutorial [Creating a simple hybrid app with AngularJS, Ionic and Cordova](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCnGSOaaZFo)

Bert also created a tutorial (blog and video) with the end result of having the instrumented app delivering Dynatrace UEM Data
