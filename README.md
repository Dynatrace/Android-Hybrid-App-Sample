# Android-Hybrid-App-Sample

This sample app has been shared by Bert Van der Heyden, APM Consultant at RealDolmen Belgium.
Bert wanted to show how easy it is to instrument a Mobile Hybrid App with Dynatrace UEM. For that purpose he created a symple app based on the YouTube Tutorial [Creating a simple hybrid app with AngularJS, Ionic and Cordova](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCnGSOaaZFo)

Bert also created a [YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLIuPeFbXBA&index=46&list=PLqt2rd0eew1bmDn54E2_M2uvbhm_WxY_6) and a Blog Tutorial (to be published soon) showing the steps necessary to instrumenting a Mobile Hybrid App to capture User Experience Data with Dynatrace UEM
